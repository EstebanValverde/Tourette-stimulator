# Tourette stimulator
Bracelet stimulator for Tourette's patients

The idea of a stimulator for Tourette’s patient came from [Bárbara Maiquez et. al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.04.044), who observed the decrease in tics by stimulating the median nerve non-invasively, at the level of the wrist, by means of pulse trains at 12Hz.

In the original work of Maiquez et. al., they used a Digimiter constant current stimulation device, model DS7AH. This device is used in the laboratory and the authors propose the construction of a wristband-type device for the patient to wear all the time and activate it, for example, when they feel that tics are coming.

I was asked to collaborate in the development of the electronic circuit and the possibility of this device being brought to reality in a simple bracelet stimulator.

There are two version of software, both to minimize current consumption: by using WTC and by using Sleep functions.

THIS DEVELOPMENT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEDICAL DEVICE, BUT AS A DEVELOPMENT FOR LABORATORY TESTING, AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE USED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL
